Unsure of background - used a different shade of blue for consistency

Very small inconsistency in IE when viewing the index at 320px. Best viewed in Firefox /Chrome. 

Picture on frontpage is of lakeside books used book store, bentor harbor, southwest michigan.

Pictures of books and summarys were referenced from http://www.booksunlimited.ie

Twitter-timeline is referenced to a store call LAKESIDE BOOKS AND ART by @friesen_mary

favicon.ico would not load on all broswers despite taking every action to make it so
- clearing cache, using proper dimensions etc -
reverted to using .png

Geolocation Map is set to the rough location of where the store could be(since it apparently doesnt exists and
   ring road is just a bunch of fields.
   Can easily set the map to current lat/long but for the sake of design/concept it is set to
   the stores 'location'
